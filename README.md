📘 SQL Learning Journey & Practice Projects
This repository documents my ongoing journey in learning SQL as part of my development as a data analyst.
It contains a collection of practical exercises, analytical queries, and small SQL projects that reflect how I build my skills step by step — from basic selection and filtering to more advanced logic with grouping, subqueries, and correlated conditions.
The goal of this repository is to show my progress, my approach to problem‑solving, and my ability to work with real‑world analytical patterns.

🟦 What’s Inside
The repository includes:
• 	SQL practice tasks from different stages of learning
• 	analytical queries based on realistic business logic
• 	exercises involving aggregation, grouping, filtering, and joins
• 	tasks with nested and correlated subqueries
• 	examples of reasoning with averages, comparisons, and conditional logic
• 	commented solutions that explain how each query works
Each file represents a part of my learning process and demonstrates how I gradually move from simple operations to more complex analytical thinking.

🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as:
• 	a record of my SQL learning progress
• 	a portfolio of practical analytical tasks
• 	a demonstration of my ability to write clean, structured SQL
• 	a place where I collect and refine solutions as I grow in data analytics
It reflects not only the final answers but also the way I think through problems and improve over time.
