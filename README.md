The First Months of SQL
This repository contains SQL practice tasks completed during the first month of a 9‑month data analytics training program.
The exercises are based on real assignments and reflect practical business logic across two domains:
- Academic analytics — teachers, departments, student groups
- Hospital analytics — wards, buildings, examinations
Each query is written in clean, readable SQL and demonstrates structured problem-solving.

📘 Topics Covered
- Aggregation: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- Filtering: WHERE, BETWEEN, logical operators
- Grouping: GROUP BY, HAVING
- Subqueries and nested logic
- Date and time functions (DATEDIFF)
- Conditional filtering based on averages
- Real-world business logic and analytical reasoning

Each .sql file contains:
- task description
- working SQL query
- comments explaining the logic

🧠 Purpose
This project documents the first stage of my SQL learning journey.
It demonstrates my ability to:
- write clean and structured SQL
- work with grouped and aggregated data
- apply real-world logic to analytical tasks
- solve complex queries using nested reasoning
- organize learning materials for public portfolio use
